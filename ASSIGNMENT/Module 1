(1). What is software?

Anc:-
software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate a
computer and execute specific tasks. In simpler terms, software tells a
computer how to function. Itâ€™s a generic term used to refer to
applications, scripts, and programs that run on devices such as PCs,
mobile phones, tablets, and other smart devices. Software contrasts
with hardware, which is the physical aspects of a computer that
perform the work. (1)System Software,(2) Application Software

(2). Types ofsoftware?

Anc:-
there are different types of software based on their classification
however, if we broadly classify the types of software in a computer,
there are two major types as listed below:

*system softwere
*application softwere

(3).What is Software Development Methodology? 

Anc:-

Software Development Methodology refers to a systematic approach or framework used in the process of planning, structuring, designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and maintaining an information system.
It provides a structured process for developing software, guiding the development team through various phases to ensure that the end product meets the desired quality, functionality, and efficiency.

(1) What isthe differencebetweenApplicationsoftwareandsystem software?

Anc:-


The main differences between application software and system software lie in their purposes, functions, and interactions within a computer system. Here's a concise breakdown of the distinctions:


System Software:
Primarily responsible for managing and controlling computer hardware.
It provides a platform for running application software and facilitates communication between hardware and software components.

Application Software:
Designed to perform specific tasks for end-users, addressing their needs and requirements.

(2).Explain the SDLC Each faceProcess?

Anc:-
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology
with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in
detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of
software development:

*Requirement analysis
*Planning
*Software design such as architectural design
*Software development
*Testing
*Deployment
